To install libtap on a Unix-like system:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/libtap ..
    make
    make check
    make install

On Windows, the library can be created by first setting up the
correct development environment variables. Usually this is done by
running vcvars32.bat included in the Visual Studio distribution.

If you want to use it directly in another project, you can copy tap.c
and tap.h there and it shouldn't have a problem compiling.

    $ ls
    tap.c tap.h test.c
    $ cat test.c
    #include "tap.h"
    int main () {
        plan(1);
        ok(50 + 5, "foo %s", "bar");
        done_testing();
    }
    $ gcc test.c tap.c
    $ a.out
    1..1
    ok 1 - foo bar
